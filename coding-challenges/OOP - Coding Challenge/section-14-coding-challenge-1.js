// Coding Challenge #1

/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement a Car. A car has a make and a speed property. The speed property is the current speed of the car in km/h;
2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console;
3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console;
4. Create 2 car objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them.

DATA CAR 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h
DATA CAR 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

bmw.accelerate(); // BMW is going at 140 km/h
bmw.brake(); // BMW is going at 135 km/h
bmw.accelerate(); // BMW is going at 145 km/h

mercedes.accelerate(); // Mercedes is going at 105 km/h
mercedes.brake(); // Mercedes is going at 100 km/h
